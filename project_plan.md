# Hollywood and Gender: A Quantitative Analysis of Movie Dialogues

##Summary
This project will quantify how male and female characters are represented in the movies of this corpus, highlighting both similarities and difference as they arise in each interaction. I will look at changes over time (based on film release date) and based on the gender of the writer(s) and director(s).

##Data:
The data come from the [Cornell Movie-Dialogue Corpus](https://convokit.cornell.edu/documentation/movie.html). There is significant metadata already present in the corpus, including the gender of the characters speaking. Where there is missing metadata I will work on filling in the gaps (some characters are not coded for gender, I will attempt to fill in the gaps here). The data is housed in separate .txt files so there will be joining and cross-reference work to do.

##Analysis:
I will explore how male and female characters are represented through dialogue of the movies in the corpus. I will use discourse analysis to guide my quantitative work, including metrics like number of turns and turn length (based on sentences and words). I will look for elements of hedging and politeness based on a set list of lexical items. If time allows, I can also create a Naive Bayes Classifier from the data to guess the gender of the speaker of an utterance. I may POS tag the conversations to see if there are any trends in POS distribution.

##Presentation:
I will give a brief overview of the field I am working in (gender and discourse analysis) as a way to help foreground the work.
